And any cell aligned with the true value will be admitted into our final result, and any sign aligned with a false value will not. \n",

    "Boolean masking is powerful conceptually and is the cornerstone of efficient NumPy and pandas querying. This technique is well used in other areas of computer science, for instance, in graphics. But it doesn't really have an analogue in other traditional relational databases, so I think it's worth pointing out here. Boolean masks are created by applying operators directly to the pandas series or DataFrame objects. For instance, in our Olympics data set, you might be interested in seeing only those countries who have achieved a gold medal at the summer Olympics. To build a Boolean mask for this query, we project the gold column using the indexing operator and apply the greater than operator with a comparison value of zero. This is essentially broadcasting a comparison operator, greater than, with the results being returned as a Boolean series. The resultant series is indexed where the value of each cell is either true or false depending on whether a country has won at least one gold medal, and the index is the country name. "

    "When you find yourself talking about pandas and saying phrases like, often I want to, it's quite likely the developers have included a shortcut for this common operation. For instance, in this example, we don't actually have to use the where function explicitly. The pandas developers allow the indexing operator to take a Boolean mask as a value instead of just a list of column names. The syntax might look a little messy, especially if you're not used to programming languages with overloaded operators, but the result is that you're able to filter and reduce data frames relatively quickly. \n",

In our Olympics data, we indexed the data frame by the name of the country. Indices can either be inferred, such as when we create a new series without an index, in which case we get numeric values, or they can be set explicitly, like when we use the dictionary object to create the series, or when we loaded data from the CSV file and specified the header. Another option for setting an index is to use the set_index function. This function takes a list of columns and promotes those columns to an index. Set index is a destructive process, it doesn't keep the current index. If you want to keep the current index, you need to manually create a new column and copy into it values from the index attribute. Let's go back to our Olympics DataFrame. "
