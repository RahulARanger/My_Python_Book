P-hacking results in spurious correlations instead of generalizable results. There are a couple of different ways you can deal with p-hacking. The first is called the Bonferroni correction. In this case, you simply tighten your alpha value, the threshold of significance based on the number of tests you're running. So if you choose 0.05 with 1 test, you want to run 3 test, you reduce alpha by multiplying 0.05 by one-third to get a new value of 0.01 sub. I personally find this approach to be very conservative. Another option is to hold out some of your data for testing to see how generizable your result is. In this case, we might take half of our data for each of the two data frames, run our T test with that. Form specific hypothesis based on the result of these tests, then run very limited tests on the rest of the data. \n",
