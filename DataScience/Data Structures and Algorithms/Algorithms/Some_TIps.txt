TODO: This are the some of the observations that i have noticed while practicing some of the problems

TODO: SO this is the rough Estimation


? First know the fact that a particular problem can be solved using any algorithms and with any data structure

? If a problem can be solved in only in a particular way then u don't need to look for general cases we can use greedy algorithms
? like the largest number from the digits

! Estimate the time complexities of the algorithms that we are gonna use

* should be better than the naive algorithm
* works efficiently
TODO: There are some problems in which we are required to vist all the possiblites 
TODO: like the closest pair of points among the pair of points

TODO: Merge sort algorithm is very important it can be used to solve other problems
